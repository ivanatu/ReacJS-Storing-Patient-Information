  ### My proposal

## What problem are you trying to solve?
Am trying to create and web application in React that allows clients to add employees from different countries . This app
should have fields accustomed to each specific country.
## Why should we solve it?
We should solve it because different clients may want to use the platform for different purposes.
Its not a big problem but it might take some time to solve.
## How do you propose to solve it?
First of all i created the front end app without mockups. Firstly i think we would need a UI/UX designer to assist in that.
Secondly i would need to add a back end to it and also add a database to store the employee information.
The backend would help us fetch the data from the frontend to the database and vice versa.
## What other approaches did you consider?
In general , for now my approach would have the application ready is staging and tested by the QA team and then we would get 
feedback on the product and lastly would be to implement feedback and send to production to receive customer feedback.
## What could go wrong?
For now the timeframe wouldnt be on our side but i think with proper planning all would be well.
